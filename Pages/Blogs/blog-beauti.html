            <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
            <p>Portrait photography is an art that goes beyond capturing a person's appearance. Whether in a controlled
                studio setting or natural outdoor environment, mastering lighting, composition, and angles is essential
                to create striking and expressive images.</p>

            <p>Equally important is building a genuine connection with your subjects. Making them feel comfortable and
                confident allows their true personality and emotions to come through, resulting in portraits that are
                not only visually appealing but also deeply authentic.</p>
